#
# Record and Replay compile-time parameters
#
# RR_MAIN_WAIT_LOOP_TIMEOUT_IN_REPLAY controls how long to wait in the select
#     call to service monitor file descriptors
#
# RR_REPORT_PROGRESS controls whether progress indicator is printed to stdout.
#     The progress indicator currently consists of two measures - percent of
#     instructions executed and percent of record log consumed.  This
#     indicator is particularly useful as there is otherwise no feedback of
#     how the replay is proceeding (e.g. VGA devices are not run in replay)
#
# RR_PROGRESS_FREQ controls the frequency of progress reports.  The value here
#    is a bit bizarre - this is the number of main_loop() iterations in vl.c.  It
#    bears some relation to the number of guest instructions executed, but is not
#    a direct measure.
#
# RR_CFLAGS is also a good opportunity to inject other DEBUG compile-time
# parameters
#
RR_CFLAGS = -DRR_MAIN_WAIT_LOOP_TIMEOUT_IN_REPLAY=0 -DRR_REPORT_PROGRESS -DRR_PROGRESS_FREQ=10000 -DRR_QUIT_AFTER_REPLAY
